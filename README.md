## Anime Rating Prediction Project

The Anime Rating Prediction project is designed to predict the user ratings of anime titles using machine learning techniques.

### Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the ratings users might give to various anime titles based on their features. This involves collecting anime data, preprocessing it, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

### Components

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - **Data Scraping:** Anime data is scraped from MyAnimeList using web scraping techniques. This includes extracting information such as anime titles, user scores, popularity metrics, and genres.
   - **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** The collected data is cleaned to handle missing values and outliers. Categorical variables like genres are encoded for model compatibility.

2. **Word Embedding with Word2Vec:**
   - **Word2Vec Model:** Anime titles are tokenized and used to update a pre-trained Word2Vec model. This ensures that all anime titles in the dataset have corresponding word vectors, aiding in natural language processing tasks during model training.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - **Neural Network Model:** A TensorFlow-based neural network is implemented to predict anime ratings. The model architecture includes dense layers with ReLU activations, dropout for regularization, and a linear output layer.
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) to quantify prediction accuracy.
   - **Training History Visualization:** Training history, including loss and metrics, is visualized using matplotlib to assess model convergence and performance over epochs.

### Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, gensim, nltk
- **Web Scraping:** requests, BeautifulSoup
- **Data Visualization:** matplotlib

### Installation and Usage

To replicate this project locally, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Clone the repository, set up dependencies, and run scripts for data scraping, model training, and evaluation as per the instructions in the `README.md`.

### Conclusion

The Anime Rating Prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict anime ratings based on diverse data sources and natural language processing. It serves as a foundation for further exploration into anime recommendation systems and user behavior analytics in entertainment domains.
